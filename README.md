## Debugit 2022


## Introduction
Debugit is a week long hackathon open to ideas in a very literal sense. You can make anything from the projects' list we'll share or ignite the inquisitive Bob the Builder inside you to make something exciting and completely new!

## How to make a submission?
Submissions are to be made through GitHub Pull Requests. To know more about how to make a GitHub Pull Request you can refer the [Fundamentals of Git](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLt4yMoVgczVgFcTzT60U5IXtNX1qjHL9) playlist which contains everything that you would need.

## Make sure to include
  - A README.md file with your name, contact information, project description and how to run the code (and other necessary information).
  - A folder containing a demo video of your project.

## Here is a detailed step by step walkthrough if you don't know how to make a Debugit submission.
