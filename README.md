Project Description

This is Anika Singh's Debug It' 22 project. Ladder is a website developed by me which basicaly aims to nurutre and provide a way for ideas by newbies/beginners.
This project is made using HTML, CSS and JS.

What are it's objectives?

Ladder is a website developed by me which basically aims to nurture and provide a path to ideas by newbies/beginners. The problem faced initially by beginners in making a start up is that though their idea is good but is rejected at many competitions/ hackathons due to high competition. To solve this problem this site is made where one can upload their ideas no matter what their scalability and requirements are. The uploaded ideas are rated by viewers of this site and professional companies
registered with the site can also fund your idea if they find it good enough. Apart from this free mentorship can also be provided by people who have worked on that type of idea before to help the beginners grow and make their way out. Ladder serves as a connecting link between those who want some ideas (companies) and those who have ideas. This website will motivate people to stay and work on their innovative idea. Both the sides (companies and idea creators) will be benefited heavily via Ladder.
