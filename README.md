## Project Description
This is a website that NGO's will use so that those NGO's that are focused on assisting children can do so through this. Basically, the orphanage must register on the website, which will include information on all of the children as well as details of each child's past and upcoming appointments. There will be also a section for booking appointments.

## What are it's objectives
Children's health is not being taken seriously in orphanages. Even if the orphanage wanted to, the cost of health care is prohibitively exorbitant. All previous and upcoming appointment information, as well as the greatest care from top experts, will be available here.
