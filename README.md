# SecondCycle
Deployed : [Website](https://secondcycle-bc49d.web.app)

## Introduction
Facing issues in finding a bicycle at the campus? Worry not!
SecondCycle strives to bridge the gap and bring sellers and buyers on the same platform.

## Technologies:

- [ ] ReactJS (with React Router) as the Javascript library
- [ ] TailwindCSS as the styling library
- [ ] Firestore as the database
- [ ] Firebase for authentication and hosting

I only set up Google Auth, as we need to signin with our institute ids only.

## Installation

### Prerequisite
Node must be installed on your device

To  setup:
1. Clone this repo with:
```
git clone --branch vaibhav-secondcycle https://github.com/crsdvaibhav/Debugit_2022.git
```
2. The in the terminal run(for dependencies):
```
npm install
```
3. Now run this in the terminal
```
npm start
```

Wait for the website to fire up on: http://localhost:3000/

### Some issues which I couldn't fix in the given time:
1. While login from mobile, instead of pop-up a new tab opens, causing user to click login twice(works perfectly on PC)
2. While navigating through different pages, you have to login again and again in the Profiles page. 

Hope to clear these in upcoming days.
