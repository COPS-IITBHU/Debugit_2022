Then comes the gaming home page which offers you three interesting fun games. You can click on any game and explore them.

The first game is - Guess My Number In this game, a random number would be generated between 1 and 20 and you need to guess the correct number with the given hints in minimum attempts. Lesser the attempts, greater would be your score. Well, it might sound that the game is totally based on luck? But no, implementation of the Binary Search Technique would always land you with a great score. Well, do not ponder and try to guess the number ðŸ™‚

Then we have the famous game which would refresh your childhood memories - Tic Tac Toe There are two modes in the game - Single Player which allows you to play with the AI and the Multi Player mode in which you can play with your friend. You need to fill in noughts or crosses and as soon as you put them three in a row, Voila, you win!

Then, there comes the color picker game which shall display a random RGB value on the top, three colored cards in easy mode and six colored cards in hard mode. On selecting the colored card that matches the RGB code displayed on the top, you win!
