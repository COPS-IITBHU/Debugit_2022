            In Nazi Germany in early April 1945, the Allies meet fanatical Waffen-SS resistance. Don "Wardaddy" Collier, a battle-hardened US Army Staff sergeant in the 2nd Armored Division, commands a Sherman tank nicknamed Fury and its veteran crew: gunner Boyd "Bible" Swan, loader Grady "Coon-Ass" Travis, driver Trini "Gordo" Garcia, and bow gunner "Red", all of whom have fought together since the North African campaign. Red is killed and replaced by private Norman Ellison, a young clerk with no combat experience.

As Fury moves deeper into Germany, Norman's inexperience becomes dangerous: He spots but fails to shoot a team of Hitler Youth who ambush the platoon leader's tank with a Panzerfaust, killing its entire crew. Later, Norman hesitates under fire during a skirmish and as a result, Don finds a captured German soldier and gives Norman his M1917 Revolver, ordering him to execute the prisoner. When he refuses, Don wrestles the revolver into his hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the prisoner and traumatizing Norman.

After the platoon captures a small town, Don and Norman search an apartment and encounter a frightened woman, Irma, and her younger cousin, Emma. Don pays them for a meal and hot water while Norman and Emma bond. At Don's urging, Norman and Emma go into the bedroom for sex. Later, as the four sit down to eat, the rest of the crew drunkenly barges in. They harass the women and bully Norman until Don puts a stop to it. As the crew returns to the tank, German artillery hits the town, killing Irma and Emma.

The platoon receives orders to capture and hold a crossroads to protect the division's rear. En route, they are ambushed by a Tiger I tank, which manages to destroy three American tanks. Fury destroys the Tiger by outmaneuvering it. Unable to notify his superiors because the radio has been damaged, Don decides they must complete their mission rather than risk going back. Upon arriving at the crossroads, Fury is immobilized by a Teller mine. Don sends Norman to scout a nearby hill, from which he sees a large number of Waffen-SS approaching. Don decides to stay, informing the others they are permitted to leave if they wish. Norman volunteers to stay with Don and the rest of the crew decides to fight as well.

The men disguise Fury to appear destroyed and hide inside. They give Norman the nickname "Machine" to show their acceptance of him and share a bottle of brandy together. They inflict heavy casualties on the unexpecting Germans. Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust, Gordo is shot and drops a live grenade into the tank and is subsequently killed while throwing himself onto it to protect the others, and a sniper kills Bible and severely wounds Don. Norman wants to surrender, but Don warns him he will be tortured and killed. Out of ammunition and surrounded, Don orders Norman to escape through the floor hatch as the Germans drop grenades into the tank. Norman slips out just before they explode, and Don is killed. Norman tries to hide in the mud underneath Fury, but is spotted by a young Waffen-SS soldier, who decides to move on, sparing Norman's life.

The next morning, Norman is awakened and crawls back into Fury. While inside, he hears someone on top of the tank and arms himself with Don's revolver. The hatch opens and Norman prepares to fight, but realizes that the soldier is American. As Norman is driven away, the rest of the American soldiers continue their march into the heart of Germany.
