       <p>
        The Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University),owes it's
        existence to the farsighted vision and relentless efforts of the founder <b>Mahamana
        Madan Mohan MalaviyaJi</b>, who created the first comprehensive residential university of
        India. Three engineering and
        technological institutions were
        established viz. the Benaras Engineering
        College (BENCO) in 1919, the College of
        Mining and Metallurgy (MINMET) in
        1923, and the College of Technology
        (TECHNO) in 1932, as the constituent
        units of Banaras Hindu University. The
        first-ever Bachelor degree course
        Electrical, Mechanical, Metallurgy,
        Mining, Ceramics, and Pharmaceutics in India were pioneered at BHU, while
        Pharmaceutics also being the first in Asia. After country's independence in 1947,
        postgraduate and doctoral research programs were also introduced here. These
        colleges produced outstanding engineers who led various indigenous industries,academic institutions, and R&D laboratories
        both within and outside the country.
        The three colleges were merged to form the instiute of technology <b>(IT, BHU) in 1968.</b>
        The erstwhile institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, has been converted into the <b>Indian 
        Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varnsasi</b> w.e.f. 29 <sup>th</sup> June 2012. Since then, the 
        IIT has witnessed several significant academic and developmental programs and new initiatives in all spheres of the Institute.

       <p>
           In the first semester, I noticed that many students missed their quizzes or assignments<br>
            just because they didn't made a day planner for themselves...and suffered a huge grade<br>
             loss which would impact their grades drastically and to resolve this issue, this webpage is created..<br>
             Hope you find it useful
